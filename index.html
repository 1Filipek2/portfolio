          Hi! I'm a developer from Slovakia. I focus on low-level programming, networking, and web development. I mainly work with C, C++, HTML, CSS, and PHP, and I'm currently diving deeper into JavaScript. I love learning new tech, contributing to open source, and building efficient, practical tools. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!

              I have a solid grasp of HTML and CSS, and I'm currently learning JavaScript to expand my frontend skills. I also have experience with PHP, where I learned to create and manage databases, as well as write backend scripts for dynamic websites. Over the years, I've worked on various projects, from simple personal pages to more complex web applications. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my workflow.

            <div class="skill-desc">
              My main experience is with C and C++, which I use for systems programming, embedded projects, and performance-critical applications. I also have beginner experience with C#, which I’m gradually exploring. I enjoy learning how computers work under the hood and writing code that interacts directly with the operating system or hardware.

            <div class="skill-desc">
              Linux has been my daily driver for more than 2 years, and I’m passionate about open-source software. I’m comfortable working with a variety of distributions, especially Fedora Server, where I’ve set up automated deployments and managed server environments. I’m always looking for ways to make systems more efficient, secure, and reliable.

              I have a solid understanding of computer networking principles and practical skills. I am familiar with the OSI and TCP/IP models, network protocols (such as Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ARP, ICMP, DNS, DHCP, HTTP, SMTP, FTP), and the basics of network addressing and subnetting (IPv4/IPv6). I understand how routers, switches, and other network devices operate, and I know how to analyze and troubleshoot network communication. My knowledge also includes error detection methods, network topologies, and basic network security concepts. I am comfortable configuring simple networks and working with Linux networking tools.

            <div class="skill-desc">
              I enjoy experimenting with game development, mainly using C++. As a semester project, I created a console-based RPG game in C++, where I focused on game logic, turn-based mechanics, and user interaction in the terminal. I'm interested in exploring more advanced frameworks and engines in the future to expand my skills beyond console applications.
